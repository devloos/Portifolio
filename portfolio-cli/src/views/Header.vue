        Web Developer for Ethika Inc. I am very passionate about programming and the whole
        package it comes with. Some of my goals are to get into a good university known
        for Computer Science. Accomplishing this would lead me to another goal of mine :
        pushing for a FAANG SWE Position. I am very motivated and willing to tackle any
        sort of problem tossed to me.
